Multicloud Surveillance Platform is a production-ready reference implementation for smart video monitoring across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This demo repo distills the platform story into customer-facing assets that you can share with prospects, investors, or leadership without exposing internal infrastructure code.

## Highlights
- Unified video ingestion, analytics, and alerting with regional failover baked in.
- Edge-to-cloud orchestration that keeps sensitive frames on-prem while streaming metadata to the cloud for AI enrichment.
- Fully managed compliance posture with configurable data retention and audit trails out of the box.
