# Platform Features

Multicloud Surveillance Platform brings enterprise-grade observability, governance, and AI insights to hybrid video fleets. The following sections summarize the production features showcased in the demo environment.

## Core Capabilities
- **Cloud-Agnostic Feed Onboarding** — auto-provision enrollment endpoints across AWS, Azure, and GCP with unified IAM controls.
- **Adaptive Streaming Pipeline** — HLS/DASH and low-latency WebRTC delivery tuned per region, backed by edge transcoding for constrained networks.
- **Event-Driven Analytics** — real-time detections using managed GPU pools; supports anomaly detection, occupancy counting, and custom TensorFlow/PyTorch models.
- **Resilient Storage Strategy** — hot footage cached regionally, warm storage mirrored to object stores, and cold archives tiered to glacier-class services.
- **Workflow Automation** — native integrations with ServiceNow, PagerDuty, Slack, and Microsoft Teams to orchestrate incident resolution.

## Architecture Overview
1. **Ingestion Layer** routes RTSP/ONVIF streams through regional collectors and automatically scales with Kubernetes HPA.
2. **Processing Layer** enriches frames with metadata, anonymizes PII, and publishes events to a cross-cloud event bus.
3. **Analytics Fabric** orchestrates ML pipelines, delivering dashboards in Grafana and embedding insights into downstream systems.
4. **Observability Spine** aggregates metrics, traces, and logs with Prometheus, Loki, and OpenTelemetry exports per tenant.

## Security & Compliance
- End-to-end encryption using customer-managed keys and automatic certificate rotation.
- Fine-grained RBAC with attribute-based access control (ABAC) for feed groups and data policies.
- Built-in compliance packs covering GDPR, SOC 2, CJIS, and regional data sovereignty rules.
- Automated secret scanning, dependency audits, and infrastructure policy checks running on every build.

## Extensibility
- Drop-in SDKs for web, mobile, and third-party monitoring panels.
- Webhook and GraphQL APIs for custom alerting flows.
- Terraform, Pulumi, and GitOps templates for provisioning greenfield or brownfield deployments.
