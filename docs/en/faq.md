# FAQ

**How does access work after purchase?**  
We send a GitHub invite to the username/email provided during checkout within one business day. Access lasts for at least six months and is renewed automatically when you extend your plan.

**Can we showcase this to customers?**  
Yes. The demo assets are designed for pre-sales conversations. Keep infrastructure diagrams internal unless the NDA allows sharing.

**Is the code production-ready?**  
The demo repo exposes narrative assets only. The hardened infrastructure code lives in the private engineering repository.

**Do we get updates?**  
Bug fixes and lightweight enhancements ship monthly for six months. Major upgrades land twice a year and may require a renewal.

**What if we need help deploying?**  
Add the Install Assist add-on for a 45-minute remote session. For deeper engagements, contact us for a custom success plan.

**Which languages are supported?**  
English, Spanish, and Portuguese (Brazil) assets ship simultaneously, ensuring global go-to-market teams stay aligned.
