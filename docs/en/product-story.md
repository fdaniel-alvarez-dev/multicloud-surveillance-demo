# Product Story

Multicloud Surveillance Platform modernizes large-scale video monitoring without locking teams into a single cloud. The demo highlights how we combine intelligent analytics, resilient infrastructure, and human-centered workflows.

## Narrative Arc
1. **Connect** — onboarding agents register monitoring endpoints through a secure portal that enforces compliance policies from the first frame.
2. **Observe** — adaptive streaming keeps mission-critical feeds live, even during regional outages or bandwidth drops.
3. **Understand** — AI pipelines enrich frames with object detection, crowd insights, and dwell time analytics to surface actionable signals.
4. **Respond** — automated playbooks route incidents to the right teams with context-rich alerts and collaboration tools.

## Why It Matters
- **Regulated industries** can meet data residency requirements while keeping centralized governance.
- **Retail and smart city operators** gain real-time situational awareness and trend analytics in a single pane of glass.
- **Platform teams** inherit a hardened blueprint that scales across clouds with GitOps-driven operations.

- Endpoint enrollment walkthrough (Slides 3–5 of the launch deck).
- Grafana dashboard template with dedicated tabs for security, operations, and finance leads.
